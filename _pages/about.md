Hi there! I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), majoring in Astrophysics with a minor in Mathematics. Currently, I am an undergraduate research assistant in Prof. Helvi Witek's Gravity Group, working under the guidance of Dr. Elena Koptieva. Previously, I had the privilege to work with Prof. Tony Wong in the Astronomy Department on an indepedent research. My research interests include gravitational physics, cosmology, and black hole physics.

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Astronomy or Physics starting in Fall 2025. If you think there is a good fit, please reach out!
