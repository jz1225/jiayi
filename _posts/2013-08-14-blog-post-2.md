WKB method in quantum mechanics

# WKB Method Review

## Overview
The **WKB approximation** applies to quantum systems where the potential \( V(x) \) varies smoothly. It provides approximate solutions for the wavefunction \( \psi(x) \) in both classical and non-classical regions.

---

## Classical Region (\( E > V(x) \))

In the **classical region**, where the energy \( E \) is greater than the potential \( V(x) \), the wavefunction \( \psi(x) \) takes the form:

$$
\psi(x) = \frac{C}{\sqrt{\rho(x)}} e^{\pm \frac{i}{\hbar} \int \rho(x) \, dx}
$$

- \( \rho(x) = \sqrt{2m \left( E - V(x) \right)} \) is the local momentum.
- This region corresponds to the oscillatory behavior of the wavefunction.

---

## Non-Classical Region (\( E < V(x) \))

In the **non-classical region**, where \( E < V(x) \), the wavefunction exhibits exponential decay or growth:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{C}{\sqrt{|\rho(x)|}} e^{\pm \frac{1}{\hbar} \int |\rho(x)| \, dx}
\]

- Here, \( \rho(x) = \sqrt{2m \left( V(x) - E \right)} \) becomes imaginary, leading to non-oscillatory solutions.

---

## Schrödinger Equation in the Non-Classical Region

The differential form of the Schrödinger equation in this region becomes:

\[
\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} = -\frac{p^2}{\hbar^2} \psi
\]

- \( p^2 = 2m \left( E - V(x) \right) < 0 \) makes the momentum imaginary.

---

## General Wavefunction Solution

Assuming the wavefunction can be expressed as:

\[
\psi(x) = A(x) e^{i \phi(x)}
\]

The first and second derivatives are:

\[
\frac{d \psi}{dx} = \left( A' + i A \phi' \right) e^{i \phi}
\]

\[
\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} = \left( A'' + 2i A' \phi' + i A \phi'' - A (\phi')^2 \right) e^{i \phi}
\]

---

## Separation into Real and Imaginary Components

The real and imaginary components of the equation yield:

### Real Equation:
\[
A'' - A (\phi')^2 = -\frac{p^2}{\hbar^2} A
\]

### Imaginary Equation:
\[
2 A' \phi' + A \phi'' = 0
\]

---

## WKB Approximation and Simplification

Using the WKB approximation, where \( A'' \to 0 \), the following relation is derived:

\[
(\phi')^2 = \frac{p^2}{\hbar^2}
\]

This leads to:

\[
\phi(x) = \pm \frac{i}{\hbar} \int |\rho(x)| \, dx
\]

Thus, the wavefunction becomes:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{C}{\sqrt{|\rho(x)|}} e^{\pm \frac{1}{\hbar} \int |\rho(x)| \, dx}
\]

---

## Application: Bumpy Barrier Tunneling

For a barrier with a varying potential:

- For \( x < 0 \), the wavefunction is:
  \[
  \psi(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}
  \]

- For \( x > a \), the wavefunction is:
  \[
  \psi(x) = F e^{ikx}
  \]

- Inside the barrier \( 0 \leq x \leq a \):
  \[
  \psi(x) \approx \frac{C}{\sqrt{|\rho|}} e^{\frac{1}{\hbar} \int |\rho| \, dx} + \frac{D}{\sqrt{|\rho|}} e^{-\frac{1}{\hbar} \int |\rho| \, dx}
  \]

If the barrier is sufficiently high or wide, the coefficient \( C \) can be set to zero, leading to:

\[
T = \left| \frac{F}{A} \right|^2 \approx e^{-2 \gamma}, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\hbar} \int |\rho| \, dx
\]

---

## Summary

The WKB approximation provides a way to solve quantum mechanical systems with slowly varying potentials. In the classical region, the wavefunction oscillates, while in the non-classical region, it decays or grows exponentially. The method is particularly useful for problems involving tunneling, such as quantum barriers with varying shapes.
