# overview

wkb method can be used for effective potentials which have the form of a barrier potential, approaching to a constant value at the event horizon and cosmological horizon or spatial infinity, but the existing approaches and package only deal with the special case in which the potential has the form $U(x,\omega) = \omega^2 - V_{eff}(x)$ \cite{Konoplya2019}. this package needs to be adapted for arbitrary form of $U(x,\omega).$

## overview of related works

the foundational wkb method for calculating the real and imaginary components of qnm frequencies was introduced by iyer and will \cite{IyerWill1987}, who carried the wkb approximation to the third order. this method was further extended to the sixth order by konoplya \cite{Konoplya2018}, and later to the thirteenth order by matyjasek and opala \cite{Matyjasek2017}. in 2019, konoplya developed a mathematica package implementing the wkb method up to the 13th order \cite{Konoplya2019}. however, this package assumes a schwarzschild black hole with a potential of the form $U = V_{\text{eff}} - \omega^2$, where the schrödinger-like equation is expressed as:

$$
\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} = U(x) \psi(x).
$$

this is a special case of the more general wkb formulation described by iyer and will \cite{IyerWill1987}. iyer also solved the frequencies for the schwarzschild case in \cite{Iyer1987}.  

while exploring works for the application of wkb to charged scalar fields in the background of charged spherically symmetric black holes, i found gonzález et al. \cite{Gonzalez2022}: they used the chebyshev method for numerically solving the frequencies and the wkb method for analytical results. other papers briefly touch on adapting the wkb method to charged scalar fields, which require a potential of the form:

$$
U = V - \omega^2 + 2 \frac{q Q}{r} \omega,
$$

as discussed in \cite{Konoplya2002} and \cite{IyerWill1987}.
