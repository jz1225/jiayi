# Overview

The WKB (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin) method is a powerful semi-analytical technique used to compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes by approximating the solutions to the Schrödinger-like wave equation governing perturbations. It is especially effective for potentials that have the form of a barrier potential, approaching constant values at the event horizon and at spatial infinity or cosmological horizons.

Existing approaches and computational packages, however, generally only deal with the special case where the potential has the form $U(x,\omega) = V_{\text{eff}}(x) - \omega^2$ [Konoplya et al., 2019]. In this form, the dependence on the frequency $\omega$ is straightforward, allowing the standard WKB method to be applied. To study more general cases, such as potentials that depend on $\omega$ in a more complicated way, the WKB method needs to be adapted to handle an arbitrary form of $U(x,\omega)$.

The foundational WKB method for calculating the real and imaginary components of QNM frequencies was introduced by Iyer and Will [Iyer & Will, 1987], who extended the WKB approximation to third order. This method provides a semi-analytical way to compute QNM frequencies by matching WKB solutions across the potential barrier.

Konoplya [Konoplya, 2003] extended this method to sixth order, improving the accuracy of the calculations. Later, Matyjasek and Opala [Matyjasek & Opala, 2017] further extended the WKB method to thirteenth order, providing even more precise results.

In 2019, Konoplya et al. developed a Mathematica package implementing the WKB method up to the 13th order [Konoplya et al., 2019]. This package assumes a Schwarzschild black hole with a potential of the form $U = V_{\text{eff}} - \omega^2$, where the Schrödinger-like equation is expressed as:

$$
\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} = U(x) \psi(x).
$$

This formulation is a special case of the more general WKB approach described by Iyer and Will [Iyer & Will, 1987]. In a subsequent paper, Iyer solved the QNM frequencies specifically for the Schwarzschild black hole using this method [Iyer, 1987].

When exploring the application of the WKB method to charged scalar fields in the background of charged spherically symmetric black holes, we find that the potential depends on $\omega$ in a more complex way. For instance, González et al. [González et al., 2022] used the Chebyshev method for numerically solving the frequencies and applied the WKB method for analytical results. In such cases, the potential takes the form:

$$
U(x) = V(x) - \omega^2 + 2 \frac{q Q}{r} \omega,
$$

where $q$ is the charge of the scalar field, $Q$ is the charge of the black hole, and $r$ is the radial coordinate. This potential depends on $\omega$ both quadratically and linearly, complicating the application of the standard WKB method.

Adapting the WKB method to handle potentials of this general form is essential for studying the quasinormal modes of charged scalar fields and other cases where the potential has an arbitrary dependence on $\omega$. This requires a modification of the existing WKB formulas and computational techniques to accommodate the more general $U(x,\omega)$.
